            My name is Aishah Cholmondeley, and I am learning how to code!
        <br/><br/>
          My career has been a winding journey so far. I graduated from McGill
          University in 2019 with a B.Ed in Teaching ESL, found my way to an
          educational technology company called Studyo, and there began an
          interest in how millions of useful tools and websites are brought to
          life every day.
        <br/><br/>
          Today, I am happily working as a Senior Customer Success Manager at a
          legal tech company called Estateably. I tackle the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Providing onboarding sessions to users</li>
            <li>Supporting users through technical aspects of our platform</li>

              customizations

                  our internal teams

          So far, most of what I've learned about web programming has either
          come up on the job or was self-taught, but I've really enjoyed the
          opportunities it has opened up for me. Coding documents to generate
          successfully, finding creative solutions to problems, and debugging
          tricky bits of code have easily become my favourite moments at work.
          <br/><br/>
          I hope that as I learn how to code I can improve as a BA, as well as
          better my understanding of our platform and its code. I'm also excited
          to take on my own projects, as I've really enjoyed learning how to
          code and am looking forward to putting my new skills to work!
          <br/><br/>
          I'd love to connect with other web development learners and people in
          similar roles; please contact me if you'd like to reach out.
          I am quite friendly, albeit a touch awkward. :)
